# Minecraft Exchange 
The Minecraft Exchange is a program designed to emulate a real-life stock market in Minecraft. It lets users buy and
sell items at any price with a recommended price given based off of supply and demand. The program has an "Economy
Server" which has all of the economic data and an "Economy Client" which is the Minecraft Server. The MC Server would
then submit its buy and sell offers to the Economy Server after a given interval where they would be completed. After
all of the transactions that can be completed are finished, the Economy Server will then update the prices to reflect
the new state of the economy.

## This is an Economy Server standalone.
